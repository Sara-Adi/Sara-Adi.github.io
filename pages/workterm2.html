                For my second work term, I had the oppourtunity be working at KPMG on the Technology Risk Consulting team. I worked alongside a large-scale team to communicate and help companies reach their technology-related goals. I have not been able to explore the
                technology risk consulting path, so this is a work term that I was both extremely grateful for, and nervous about as I venture off to a new stream in my career.

                    with their technology systems and processes. This includes assessing the security of clients' systems and data, identifying potential vulnerabilities, and helping clients put controls in place to mitigate those risks.In addition to

            <h2 class="subtitles-2">Technology Risk Consulting (TRC)</h2>
            <p class="subtitle-content">
                The Technology Risk Consulting (TRC) team at KPMG helps organizations identify, assess, and manage the risks associated with their technology and information systems. This includes evaluating the security and reliability of an organization's systems,
                as well as the risk of data breaches, cyber-attacks, and other threats. <br><br>The team works with clients to understand their unique business needs and goals, and helps them develop strategies to mitigate technology-related
                risks. This may involve conducting risk assessments, implementing new controls and processes, and providing guidance on compliance with relevant laws and regulations. The team may also work with clients on issues related to data privacy
                and security, such as helping them implement data governance frameworks and complying with data protection regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). <br><br>Throughout this work term, I was on engagements such as
                SOC reports and a smaller engagement regarding penetration testing for the cyber security team. Each of these engagements was very different than what I worked on in my previous co-op, or even in my courses. As this term was not development/programmed
                focused, I had the chance to look at technology/IT from a different perspective. I was able to join and eventually lead walkthroughs with the client, work on both the business and IT process sides of the SOC engagements, and overall just
                look at the bigger picture and discover that there is more to technology than development. I learned through both experiences and engaging in learning conversations with my PM how businesses function around their IT processes, and how
                an entity's IT system works and is integrated with all components (i.e., accounting). I extremely enjoyed this work term as it gave me a chance to explore a different field I wouldn't have been able to otherwise.

            <p class="subtitle-content">
                Completing a co-op work term at KPMG as a technology risk consultant has been a valuable and rewarding experience. Throughout the term, I had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects for clients in various industries, which allowed me to
                expand my knowledge and skills in the field of technology risk consulting.
                <br><br>Throughout this work term, I found myself working on SOC 1 and 2 reports (of both types). As this is a field within tech that I have not been exposed to before, there was a lot of learning to do. I'm thankful I have the most supportive,
                approachable PM - Raul Fuentes Gomez -, who took the time to support me and teach me everything I needed to know in order to complete my engagements correctly. Due to this open, welcoming environment, I found myself comfortable taking
                risks early on and becoming knowledgeable in a field within technology that I would have never else been able to. Raul alongside the wonderful “Red Team”, has directed and supported me in ways that will always leave a positive impact on
                my career for the better.
                <br><br>Overall, my co-op work term at KPMG has been an invaluable experience that has helped me to grow both personally and professionally. I am excited to apply the skills and knowledge I have gained in my future studies and career.
