                For my third work term, I had the exciting opportunity to return to Tulip Retail as a co-op on the Product Delivery Team. Since I left the company at the end of my first co-op in May 2022, I knew there was still a lot for me to learn from all the talented
                individuals there. Getting the chance to come back for a second term and work with such an amazing and supportive team once again was truly the highlight of my summer. Even though I held the same job and returned to the same team, it does
                not mean that my co-op experience was anything less than filled with new experiences and challenges!

                    <span>Gain a comprehensive understanding of the duties, tools (Jira), and procedures involved in project management at Tulip Retail by shadowing a Project Manager on a project.
                        <span> My primary learning objective during my summer 2023 co-op as a software developer at Tulip was to obtain a thorough grasp of project management by observing a Project Manager in action and actively participating in their duties and tools, particularly Jira. My Area of Application/Minor is based on Project Management, and this goal was one I was espically excited for. I worked closely with the project management head to accomplish this and attended one-on-one workshops with project managers. I was able to become fully immersed in the project management process by participating in meetings and learning initiatives with the project management team. I carefully watched the Project Manager's decision-making processes throughout the shadowing and workshop sessions, interacted with the project team members to comprehend their duties, and actively became acquainted with Jira's capabilities and useful applications. As my coop term went on, I successfully applied my newly acquired project management skills, especially with Jira, to significantly contribute to the successful completion of tasks and projects that were assigned to me as a developer. In addition to broadening my skill set as a software engineer, this experience has given me a comprehensive understanding of project management's critical role in attaining organizational objectives at Tulip Retail.

                The Product Delivery team at Tulip has a wide range of responsibilities. Although my time at tulip was short, I most definitely was exposed to a magnitude of opportunities to cover a wide range of obligations the team has to deliver on.<br><br>The
                opportunity that struck me the most would be the work I completed for a client that required the development and implementation of a full order hook, that would be integrated from Tulips system and their database. Although the work itself
                seemed to be standard at first, the authorization method requested was one that Tulip did not implement in any other client previously. Although this imposed a challenge, it also opened a door to learning more about AWS. I was able to
                expose myself to professionally written documentation from Amazon directly, which taught me the importance of documentation, how to read it, take away necessary information, and implement it into a solution.<br><br>I completed the entire
                hook by using Javascript and Node JS while implementing multiple external and internal libraries. Furthermore, I developed test cases for each component of the hook to ensure no faulty/undetected code was executed. This opportunity was
                one of many I got the privilege of experiencing at Tulip, and I truly believe it strengthened me as a developer.

            <p class="subtitle-content">
                My work term at Tulip Retail reaffirmed the technical skills I'd been hoping to further develop as a professional developer, while also introducing me to new ones. I have had the privilege to be mentored by Neil St Amor, who has remarkably taught me the
                ins and outs of not only navigating my way through the Tulip system and business model (Saas) but helped guide me through my goals, ensuring I was achieving them as my term passes by exposing me to new opportunities and challenges. From
                simple localization work to developing and integrating a fully working hook for a client, my time here at Tulip has been nothing short of exciting and adventurous.
