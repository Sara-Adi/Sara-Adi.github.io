                For my third work term, I had the exciting opportunity to come back to Tulip Retail as a returning co-op on the Product Delivery Team. I knew since I last left the company at the end of my first co-op back in May of 2022, that there was still a lot left
                for me to learn from all the talent individuals there. Getting the chance to come back for a second term here, and work with such an amazing, and supporting team once again was truly the highlight of my summer. Even though I held the same
                job and returned to the same team, it does not mean that my co-op experience was filled with anything less than new experiences and challenges!

                    but they continue to surpass every achievement they set. Tulip has built a retail mobile software platform that empowers leading retailers such as Mulberry, Chanel, Saks Fifth Avenue, Kate Spade, Coach, and Michael Kors to give mobile

                The Product Delivery team at Tulip has a wide range of responsibilities. Although my time at tulip was short, I most definitely was exposed to a magnitude of opportunities to cover a wide range of obligations the team has to deliver on.<br><br>The
                opportunity that struck me the most would be the work I completed for a client that required the development and implementation of a full order hook, that would be integrated from Tulips system and their database. Although the work itself
                seemed to be standard at first, the authorization method requested was one that Tulip did not implement in any other client previously. Although this imposed a challenge, it also opened a door to learning more about AWS. I was able to
                expose myself to professionally written documentation from Amazon directly, which taught me the importance of documentation, how to read it, take away necessary information, and implement it into a solution.<br><br>I completed the entire
                hook by using Javascript and Node JS while implementing multiple external and internal libraries. Furthermore, I developed test cases for each component of the hook to ensure no faulty/undetected code was executed. This opportunity was
                one of many I got the privilege of experiencing at Tulip, and I truly believe it strengthened me as a developer.

            <p class="subtitle-content">
                My work term at Tulip Retail reaffirmed the technical skills I'd been hoping to further develop as a professional developer, while also introducing me to new ones. I have had the privilege to be mentored by Neil St Amor, who has remarkably taught me the
                ins and outs of not only navigating my way through the Tulip system and business model (Saas) but helped guide me through my goals, ensuring I was achieving them as my term passes by exposing me to new opportunities and challenges. From
                simple localization work to developing and integrating a fully working hook for a client, my time here at Tulip has been nothing short of exciting and adventurous.
